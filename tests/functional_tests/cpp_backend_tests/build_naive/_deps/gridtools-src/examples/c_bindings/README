This example demonstrate how to export C bindings using GridTools,
and how to use them from another language.

CMakeLists.txt:           Shows how to use the C bindings generator in the build
                          system.
copy_stencil_wrapper.cpp: The core functionality, exports several functions.
copy_stencil_lib_*:       Those C headers and fortran files are autogenerated
                          files when compiling the c bindings.
                          These files are generated into the source tree to give
                          the user the opportunity to check them into the version
                          control system. This is useful in case the code that
                          generates the files cnanot be run on each host (namely,
                          in case of cross compiling, the generator binary will be
                          biult for the target, and thus, cannot necessarily be
                          executed on the host system).
driver_cpu.c              Shows how to call the exported functions from C.
driver_gpu.c              Shows how to call the exported functions from C.
driver.f90                Shows how to call the exported functions from Fortran.
