GridTools examples
==================

GridTools will install the examples to ${GT\_INSTALL\_EXAMPLES\_PATH}. Each sub-directory
contains stand-alone CMake project which illustrates how to use the GridTools CMake targets.

Additionally the CMakeLists.txt in ${GT\_INSTALL\_EXAMPLES\_PATH} serves as a driver to compile
and test all examples. In general, this file can be ignored.
