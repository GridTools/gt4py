How do I build the docs?
------------------------

The documentation is based on Sphinx. Go to ``docs_src/manuals`` and do (in
your console):

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ make install

The output will be in the ``docs`` subdirectory inside the main |GT| directory.
