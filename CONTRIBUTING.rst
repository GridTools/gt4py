Contributing
============

Contributions to GT4Py are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated. Proper
credit will be given to contributors by adding their names to the
``AUTHORS.rst`` file. However, our policy is that ETH Zurich is the official
maintainer and provider of the GT4Py library. We believe that this will
provide our users with a clear reference point for support and guarantees on
timely interactions. For this reason, we require that external contributions
to GT4Py will be accepted only after their authors provide to us a signed
copy of a copyright release form to ETH Zurich.
