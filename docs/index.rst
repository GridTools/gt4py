GT4Py: GridTools for Python
===========================================================

GT4Py is a Python library for generating high performance implementations
of stencil kernels from a high-level definition using regular Python
functions. GT4Py uses `GridTools <https://github.com/GridTools/gridtools>`_
for a native implementation of the kernel, but other code-generating
backends are also available.

.. commented_out The :doc:`Quick Start Guide <quickstart>` contains some simple examples
.. commented_out of how to use GT4Py to define and run your own stencils. It is probably worth
.. commented_out to take a look there before going into the reference documentation.
