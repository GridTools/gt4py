# GT4Py Architecture Decision Records

This document contains links to all _Architecture Decision Records_ (ADR)
documents written in this project. It should convey the rationale of the
architecture in the current GT4Py codebase, and the reasons and trade-offs
behind.

New ADRs should be written at the time when significant decisions for the
project are taken and they should capture both the final decision and the
thought process that led to that. Basically, they should explain why a
feature is built the current way and not some other way. Note that even if
the reasons might look simple for the author, it could be complicated for
others to understand the decision without the proper context.

Documenting the context and the process of every decision in this way gives
other team members more information about how a component works and how it
is fits within the whole system, and it also helps the decision maker to
recall the forces driving that decision in the long term.
