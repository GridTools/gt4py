# Cartesian ADRs

This folder contains the _Architecture Decision Records_ for the cartesian part of the codebase. The [top-level README](../README.md) explains when and why we write ADRs.

## How to write ADRs

Writing and reading ADRs should be as simple as possible. Use the [template](../Template.md) as a starting point for new ADRs. Simplify as much as possible. Don't add bloat just to get a longer document. It's not worth it.
