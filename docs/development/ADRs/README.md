# Architecture Decision Records

This folder contains all _Architecture Decision Records_ (ADRs) written for this project. ADRs convey the rationale of design decisions in the codebase and the trade-offs associated with these decisions. Basically, ADRs explain why a feature is built one way and not another.

## When to write ADRs

ADRs are written when "big decisions" are taken. Good points might be when starting or before merging a feature. The pull request template thus contains a reminder.

## Why we write ADRs

Documenting design decisions with ADRs, will give all team members information about how a feature works and how it fits in the bigger picture. Even if reasons might look simple or obvious to the author at the time of writing, they could be complicated for others to understand without proper context. In the long term, it also helps the original author to recall the forces driving their decisions.
