    # TODO(tehrengruber): For embedded execution a `__call__` method and for
    #  "truly" embedded execution arguably also a `from_function` method is
    #  required. Since field operators currently have a `__gt_type__` with a
    #  Field return value, but it's `__call__` method being void (result via
    #  out arg) there is no good / consistent definition on what signature a
    #  protocol implementer is expected to provide. Skipping for now.
