    """Fuse two serial maps together.

    The transformation combines two maps into one that are connected through some
    access nodes. Conceptually this transformation removes the exit of the first
    or upper map and the entry of the lower or second map and then rewrites the
    connections appropriately. Depending on the situation the transformation will
    either fully remove or make the intermediate a new output of the second map.

    By default, the transformation does not use the strict data flow mode, see
    `MapFusionHelper` for more, however, it might be useful in come cases to enable
    it.

    Args:
        only_inner_maps: Only match Maps that are internal, i.e. inside another Map.
        only_toplevel_maps: Only consider Maps that are at the top.
        strict_dataflow: If `True`, the transformation ensures a more
            stricter version of the data flow.

    Notes:
        - This transformation modifies more nodes than it matches.
        - After the transformation has been applied simplify should be run to remove
            some dead data flow, that was introduced to ensure validity.
        - A `MapFusionSerial` obejct can be initialized and be reused. However,
            after new access nodes are added to any state, it is no longer valid
            to use the object.

    Todo:
        - Consider the case that only shared nodes are created (thus no inspection of
            the graph is needed) and make all shared. Then use the dead dataflow
            elimination transformation to get rid of the ones we no longer need.
        - Increase the applicability.
