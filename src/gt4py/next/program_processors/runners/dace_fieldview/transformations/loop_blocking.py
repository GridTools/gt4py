    """Applies loop blocking, also known as k-blocking, on a Map.

    This transformation takes a multidimensional Map and performs blocking on a
    single dimension, the loop variable is called `I` here. All dimensions except
    `I` are unaffected by this transformation. In the outer Map will be replace the
    `I` range, currently `I = 0:N`, with `__coarse_I = 0:N:B`, where `N` is the
    original size of the range and `B` is the blocking size. The transformation
    will then create an inner sequential map with `I = __coarse_I:(__coarse_I + B)`.

    What makes this transformation different from simple blocking, is that
    the inner map will not just be inserted right after the outer Map.
    Instead the transformation will first identify all nodes that does not depend
    on the blocking parameter `I`, called independent nodes and relocate them
    between the outer and inner map. Note that an independent node must be connected
    to the MapEntry or another independent node.
    Thus these operations will only be performed once, per outer loop iteration.

    Args:
        blocking_size: The size of the block, denoted as `B` above.
        blocking_parameter: On which parameter should we block.
        require_independent_nodes: If `True` only apply loop blocking if the Map
            actually contains independent nodes. Defaults to `False`.

    Todo:
        - Modify the inner map such that it always starts at zero.
        - Allow more than one parameter on which we block.

        already classified as independent. This is repeated until no new independent
        nodes are found. This means that independent nodes does not necessarily have
        a direct connection to map entry.
