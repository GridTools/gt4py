    """Applies loop blocking, also known as k-blocking, on a Map.

    This transformation takes a multidimensional Map and performs blocking on a
    single dimension, the loop variable is called `I` here. All dimensions except
    `I` are unaffected by this transformation. In the outer Map will be replace the
    `I` range, currently `I = 0:N`, with `__coarse_I = 0:N:B`, where `N` is the
    original size of the range and `B` is the blocking size. The transformation
    will then create an inner sequential map with `I = __coarse_I:(__coarse_I + B)`.

    What makes this transformation different from simple blocking, is that
    the inner map will not just be inserted right after the outer Map.
    Instead the transformation will first identify all nodes that does not depend
    on the blocking parameter `I` and relocate them between the outer and inner map.
    Thus these operations will only be performed once, per inner loop.

        blocking_size: The size of the block, denoted as `B` above.
        blocking_parameter: On which parameter should we block.
