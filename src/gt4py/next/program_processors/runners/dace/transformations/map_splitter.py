    """Split a Map based on a transient.

    The transformation matches the following pattern `MapExit -> (AccessNode)`,
    where `AccessNode` needs to a transient single use data whose only producer
    is the matched Map and has only a single consumer. Furthermore, more data
    is written into `AccessNode` than is read from it. In that case the
    producing Map and `AccessNode` is split into fragments, such that a fragment
    either generates data that is fully consumed or not at all.

    Note:
        - This transformation might generate dead dataflow that must be handled
            separately.
        - The "more data is written into `AccessNode` than read from it" technically
            violates ADR18, but is the result of some broadcast expressions in
            relation to `concat_where`.
