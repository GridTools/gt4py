class MoveDataflowIntoIfBody(dace_transformation.SingleStateTransformation):
    """The transformation moves dataflow into the if branches.

    Essentially transforms code from this
    ```python
    __arg1 = foo(...)
    __arg2 = bar(...)
    if __cond:
        __output = __arg1
    else:
        __output = __arg2
    ```
    into this
    ```python
    if __cond:
        __output = foo(...)
    else:
        __output = bar(...)
    ```
    I.e. computation that is needed in only one branch is relocated or inlined into
    that specific branch, which might reduce computation.

    Despite its name the transformation is not only able to handle `if` expressions,
    but more general `switch` like expressions. The requirements are:
    - The expression must be inside a nested SDFG containing only a `ConditionalBlock`.
    - The matched nested SDFG must be inside a Map (might be dropped).
    - For every incoming connector there must be exactly one AccessNode in the
        entire nested SDFG (might be dropped).
    - Every branch must write to every output of the nested SDFG.
    - The only dataflow allowed inside the branches is `(i) -> (o)` i.e. AccessNode
        to AccessNode connections.

    Furthermore, the transformation should be applied as long as possible, i.e.
    it should be applied by passing it to `SDFG.apply_transformations_repeated()`.

    Args:
        ignore_upstream_blocks: If `True` do not require that upstream `if_block`s
            have to be processed first.

    Note:
        - If there is a chain of suitable `if` expression, i.e. an `if` expression is
            in the upstream dataflow of the one that is currently matched, then the
            transformation will not apply. This is done to ensure that everything is
            properly inlined into the branches. This behaviour can be disabled by
            setting `ignore_upstream_blocks` to `True`.
            The reason for this behaviour is that the current implementation can only
            handle the case where the `if` expression is _directly_ inside a Map.

    Todo:
        - Allow that an inconnector can be used multiple times, as long as it is in
            different branches.
        - Extend the implementation that it is also able to handle `if_blocks` that
            are not inside a Map. This would allow to drop the need to process
            upstream `if` expressions first.
