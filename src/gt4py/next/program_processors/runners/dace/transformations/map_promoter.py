"""Callback for the `MapPromoter`.

After the `MapPromoter` has checked that the map would be promoted, the
callback is called. If the function returns `True` then transformation will
perform the promotion and in case of `False` the transformation will not
perform the promotion.
This allows user code to steer the promotion.

Args:
    state: The `SDFGState` on which the transformation operate.
    sdfg: The `SDFG` on which the transformation operate.
    first_map_exit: The `MapExit` node of the first Map, the one that is promoted.

    missing_map_parameters: The list of Map parameters that will be added to the
        first map.

@dace_properties.make_properties
class MapPromoter(dace_transformation.SingleStateTransformation):
    """Promotes a Map such that it can be fused together.

    The transformation essentially matches `MapExit -> (Intermediate) -> MapEntry`
    and modifies the first Map such that it can be fused. The essentially checks
    if the parameter of the first Map are a subset of the second Map, in case
    they match they are checked for equality. If this is the case the
    transformation will add the missing parameters to the first map.
    It is possible to influence what kind of dimensions can be added.

    As an example, the transformation will turn the following code:
    ```python
    for i in dace.map[0:N]:
        a[i] = foo(i, ...)
    for i, j in dace.map[0:N, 0:M]:
        b[i, j] = bar(a[i], i, j, ...)
    ```
    into
    ```python
    for i, j in dace.map[0:N, 0:M]:
        a[i] = foo(i, ...)
    for i, j in dace.map[0:N, 0:M]:
        b[i, j] = bar(a[i], i, j, ...)
    ```
    which can be fused together by map fusion.

    Args:
        only_inner_maps: Only match Maps that are internal, i.e. inside another Map.
        only_toplevel_maps: Only consider Maps that are at the top.
        promote_vertical: If `True` promote vertical dimensions, i.e. add them
            to the map to promote; `True` by default.
        promote_local: If `True` promote local dimensions, i.e. add them to the
            map to promote; `True` by default.
        promote_horizontal: If `True` promote horizontal dimensions, i.e. add
            them to the map to promote; `False` by default.
        promote_everything: Do not impose any restriction on what to promote. The only
            reasonable value is `True` or `False`.
        fuse_after_promotion: If `True`, the default, then fuse the two maps together
            immediately after promotion, i.e. inside `apply()`.
        promotion_callback: A callback function, see `MapPromotionCallBack`, that
            can be used to steer the promotion.

    Note:
        - The transformation will always promote the top Map never the lower Map.
        - This ignores tiling.

    Todo:
        Promotion in vertical direction, i.e. adding a vertical dimension is
        most likely all the time good, because it will create independent nodes
        that `LoopBlocking` can move out of the inner loop. However, promotion
        in horizontal, i.e. adding horizontal dimensions, is not necessarily
        good. Empirical observations have shown that it is most likely, but
        we should add a criteria to prevent the promotion in certain cases.

            #  ensured that this is the case. As an optimization, to avoid that the
            #  Map fusion transformation scans the SDFG, we will specify `assume_always_shared`.

            #  and this value has no influence on that outcome, we can specify it here.
