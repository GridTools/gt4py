    """Removes self copying across different states.

    This transformation is very similar to `SingleStateGlobalSelfCopyElimination`, but
    addresses a slightly different case. Assume we have the pattern `(G) -> (T)`
    in one state, i.e. the global data `G` is copied into a transient. In another
    state, we have the pattern `(T) -> (G)`, i.e. the data is written back.

    If the following conditions are satisfied, this transformation will remove all
    writes to `G`:
    - The only write access to `G` happens in the `(T) -> (G)` pattern. ADR-18
        guarantees, that if `G` is used as an input and output it must be pointwise.
        Thus there is no weird shifting.

    If the only usage of `T` is to write into `G` then the transient `T` will be
    removed.

    Note that this transformation does not consider the subsets of the writes from
    `T` to `G` because ADR-18 guarantees to us, that _if_ `G` is a genuine input
    and output, then the `G` read and write subsets have the exact same range.
    If `G` is not an output then any mutating changes to `G` would be invalid.

    Todo:
        - Implement the pattern `(G) -> (T) -> (G)` which is handled currently by
            `SingleStateGlobalSelfCopyElimination`, see `_classify_candidate()` and
            `_remove_writes_to_global()` for more.
        - Make it more efficient such that the SDFG is not scanned multiple times.
