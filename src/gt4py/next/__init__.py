GT4Py-NEXT - Performance portable and composable weather & climate stencils.

This module deviates from the project coding style (Google Python style) in the following way:

[style guide link](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#22-imports):

Fnctions and classes are imported from other modules in order to explicitly re-export them
to create a streamlined user experience. `from module import *` can be used but only if the
module in question is a submodule, defines `__all__` and exports many public API objects.
