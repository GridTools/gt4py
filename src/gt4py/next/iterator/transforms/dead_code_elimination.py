    Perform dead code elimination on a program by simplifying or removing
    unused or unreachable code constructs.

    This transformation is a composition of InlineLambdas, ConstantFolding, and CollapseTuple.

    Example:
    ```
    let val = {inp1, inp2}[0]
      if_ True then
        val
      else
        inp3

    # TODO(tehrengruber): we only want to inline literals here
    program = InlineLambdas.apply(program, opcount_preserving=True)

    # e.g. `let field = as_fieldop(...) in val1 end` -> `val1`.
    # TODO(tehrengruber): If we first re-arrange the tree such that let bindings are placed as
    #  close as possible to references to them we don't need to inline again here.

    # dead-code-elimination, but is needed later since the domain inference cannot handle "user"
